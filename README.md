# How to analyse the memory related issue if you are working on large iOS Codebase 

# iOS Memory Management Techniques

This repository contains a collection of effective techniques for identifying and resolving memory-related issues in large iOS codebases. As an iOS developer, you can use these strategies to optimize your app's performance and prevent crashes due to memory mismanagement.

## 1. Instruments: Leaks and Allocations
- **Leaks Instrument**: Use Xcode's Instruments tool to track memory leaks. It helps identify objects that are allocated but not properly deallocated.
- **Allocations Instrument**: Monitor memory usage and track down memory allocation patterns that may lead to high memory consumption or retention cycles.

## 2. Xcode Debug Memory Graph
The built-in Memory Graph Debugger in Xcode allows you to visualize the object graph at runtime, helping you identify strong reference cycles and memory leaks.

## 3. Profiling with Time Profiler
Use the Time Profiler instrument to detect performance bottlenecks caused by inefficient memory handling or excessive allocations.

## 4. Analyzing Retain Cycles
Check for retain cycles (strong reference cycles), especially with closures, delegate patterns, or improper usage of `weak` and `unowned` references. These cycles prevent objects from being deallocated, leading to memory growth over time.

## 5. Static Code Analysis
Xcode's Analyze feature can help you find potential memory issues like retain cycles, missing weak references, or improper memory management by analyzing your code statically.

## 6. Reducing Memory Footprint
Investigate areas where you can reduce the app's memory footprint, such as optimizing image handling, caching strategies, or data loading techniques.

## 7. Proper ARC Usage
Ensure proper usage of Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) by using `weak` and `unowned` references where applicable to avoid retain cycles.

## 8. Third-Party Tools
Consider using third-party memory profiling tools like MallocDebug or Heapshot Analysis to get a more in-depth view of memory allocations and leaks.

## 9. Large Object Lifetime Management
Identify large objects like view controllers, images, or data sets that may stay in memory longer than necessary, and implement strategies to release them when no longer needed.

## 10. Tracking Memory Warnings
Monitor memory warnings received from the OS (`UIApplication.didReceiveMemoryWarningNotification`) to understand when the app is using too much memory, and react by releasing unnecessary resources.
